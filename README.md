  1. Car Instrument Simulator (From Gaddis Starting /w Java 6th Edition. Chapter 8, #10)
  For this assignment, you will design a set of classes that work together to simulate a car’s
  fuel gauge and odometer. The classes you will design are the following:
  The FuelGauge Class: This class will simulate a fuel gauge. Its responsibilities are
  as follows:
  To know the car’s current amount of fuel, in gallons.
  To report the car’s current amount of fuel, in gallons.
  To be able to increment the amount of fuel by 1 gallon. This simulates putting fuel
  in the car. (The car can hold a maximum of 15 gallons.)
  To be able to decrement the amount of fuel by 1 gallon, if the amount of fuel is
  greater than 0 gallons. This simulates burning fuel as the car runs.
  The Odometer Class: This class will simulate the car’s odometer. Its responsibilities are
  as follows:
  To know the car’s current mileage.
  To report the car’s current mileage.
  To be able to increment the current mileage by 1 mile. The maximum mileage the
  odometer can store is 999,999 miles. When this amount is exceeded, the odometer
  resets the current mileage to 0.
  To be able to work with a FuelGauge object. It should decrease the FuelGauge
  object’s current amount of fuel by 1 gallon for every 24 miles traveled. (The car’s
  fuel economy is 24 miles per gallon.)

2. File Encryption Filter ((From Gaddis Starting /w Java 6th Edition. Chapter 11, #7 and #8))
File encryption is the science of writing the contents of a file in a secret code. Your encryption
program should work like a filter, reading the contents of one file, modifying the data
into a code, and then writing the coded contents out to a second file. The second file will be
a version of the first file, but written in a secret code.
Although there are complex encryption techniques, you should come up with a simple one
of your own. For example, you could read the first file one character at a time, and add 10
to the character code of each character before it is written to the second file.
File Decryption Filter
Write a program that decrypts the file produced by the program in Programming Challenge 7.
The decryption program should read the contents of the coded file, restore the data to its
original state, and write it to another file.
